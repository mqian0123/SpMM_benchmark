# For optimal stream performance, it is recommended to set the following OS parameters (requires root/sudo access)
echo always > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled     # Enable hugepages
echo always > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag     # Enable hugepages
echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches                            # Clear caches to maximize available RAM
echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/compact_memory                         # Rearrange RAM usage to maximise the size of free blocks

# Optimize OpenMP performance behaviour
export OMP_SCHEDULE=static  # Disable dynamic loop scheduling
export OMP_PROC_BIND=TRUE   # Bind threads to specific resources
export OMP_DYNAMIC=false    # Disable dynamic thread pool sizing

# OMP_PLACES is used for binding OpenMP threads to cores
